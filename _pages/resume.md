## Projects

**Naive Bayes classification of news articles**

* Built a Naïve Bayes classifier and categorized news articles based on their topics. 
* Improved the processing speed compared by ~ 20 -30 times via implementation in Spark

**Recommendation system for last.fm**

* Built a collaborative filtering model based on user data on last.fm for predicting possible favorite artists
* Over 24 million user ratings cleaned, transformed, and processed in Spark

**Identify fishing hotspots using geo-tagged twitter data**

* Collected and classified over 5000 geo-tagged tweets  based on location information  (spatial analysis) and textual (TFIDF) information using ensemble of neural network, random forest, and SVM and obtained F1-score of 0.85.

**Aerial image classification using deep learning**

* Trained a 3-layer CNN in Keras and Tensorflow using 324000 DeepSat aerial photographs, and the final model has an accuracy of  99.1%.
  
**Predicting spatial patterns of sediment movement using Quantile Regression Forest**

* Used QRF models to improve the prediction of  sediment movement by 10% compared to Random Forest
