I am an amateur at photography, but I am not afraid of being one. I love shooting street photography and hopefully one day I can be good at it. I love street photography because to shoot in the street you have to be sharp and adaptable, and you have to be ready at all times. For someone who is a little paranoid about the crowdedness and noise associated with the street, street photography confronts me with my inner fear and force me to challenge myself. The lens is the best friend and outlet for me to express myself. Just like the shutter, everything about street photography can be on/off at all times. But you have to keep looking.

Most of the time I use my Fujifilm X-T20 camera. I also use iPhone to take pictures sometimes.
