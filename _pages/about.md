## Who am I

I am currently working as a data analyst in Austin, Texas. I have a Ph.D. in Geographical Information Sciences at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. My interest mainly focuses on data mining, algorithms, and data visualization. I try to solve all my problems using `Python`, but would resort to other tools including `R` and `MATLAB` when necessary. I am also always interested in learning other new techniques and implement what I learn to help better problem solving and decision making.

In my spare time, I do a lot of different things. Going on a road trip and explore a mixture of cities and nature is on the top of my list. I also love photography, especially street photography and portrait. Currently I use a [Fujifilm X-T20](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t20/) camera, which is possibly the best camera I could get at the price. You can find some of my work in the [Gallery](/media/).

## Why I started this website

Yes, I have accounts at [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), and many other websites for various purposes. However, for a long time I was not even aware that I NEED a personal website. A place that is centralized so I do not have to divert my time and energy registering many usernames, memorizing my passwords, clicking through different websites. Doing all these things at different locations can be borderline frustrating and slowly I lost interest in updating all of them. 

I need a place to record my everyday ideas, my computer science notes, my playlist, my photos, my portfolio, and other things. Fortunately Github's personal page provides an ideal platform for my situation. I have full control over the stuff I write, how I decide to present them, and almost everything can be customized. Thanks to open-source tools including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), building this website was much easier than it otherwise would be.
