## Common types of graph by purpose

### Distribution

#### Raincloud plot

[Raincloud-plot](https://xeno.graphics/raincloud-plot/)

>A [raincloud-plot](https://xeno.graphics/raincloud-plot/) combines boxplots, raw jittered data, and a split-half violin.

The following raincloud plot was created by Dr. [Micah Allen's blog](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/). The original plot was created in `R` using `ggplot2`. It turns out pog87 created the [`PtitPrince`](https://github.com/pog87/PtitPrince) library to create the raincloud-plot easily in `python`.
