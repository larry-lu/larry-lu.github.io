I went to New Orleans twice in the past year for two conferences.

It was an amazing city full of fun. The French Quarter was something you would not see anywhere else in the world. It was a place where people sing, dance, and play instruments in the middle of the street, every bar was full of people, either drunk or drunk-to-be. Everybody there was having a great time. New Orleans is famous for cajun food and seafood. The charbroiled oyster at ACME was amazing, and [Po boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%27_boy) are a must, too.

I went to the World War II Museum twice. It was arguably one of the best museums I have ever been to. It has extensive collections of weapons, documents, and other military artifacts from the WWII. The museum also did a great job making the ambience, and it was easy to lose yourself in it. Both trips were super informative and mind-blowing.
