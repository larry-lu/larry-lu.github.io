I went to Savannah, GA in May 2018, right before my graduation ceremony. I always wanted to visit, and I planned this trip as a reward for my graduation. In my imaginations, Savannah was the place where [Forrest Gump](http://www.savannahtheatre.com/forrest-gump-bus-stop-bench/) waited for the bus to arrive. It was one of the most picturesque and serene city in America with Spanish moss all over its oaks. 

Walking through the historic [Forsyth Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth_Park) is relaxing. The park is also featured with historic statues and some of which date back to the Civil War. So many things have changed since, only leaving behind the statues reminding us of a chapter of the history that was heavy.

The Atlantic beach is only miles away from Downtown Savannah. We were fortunate enough to see the gorgeous sunset several times through out visit. As you might expect, there are also a variety of seafood.
