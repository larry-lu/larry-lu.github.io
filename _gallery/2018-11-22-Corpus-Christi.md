This was a short field trip for an oceanography class. We ended up doing some field surveys on the coast of the [Padre Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padre_Island). the gulf coast was still warm in mid-November with humid air. It was not a huge day for tourism, but we managed to see some people fishing, running, playing with dogs, or collecting shells. 

We managed to see birds of varied species during the field trip. Too bad I was only good enough to tell the difference between a sandpiper and a gull. There were crabs digging nests on the beach, too.
